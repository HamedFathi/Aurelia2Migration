# :black_nib: Creating A Skeleton

Before getting our hands dirty we should make our basic skeleton.

### :heart: Aurelia 1

There is a CLI for making your project. From the command line, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) use `npm` to install the CLI globally:

```bash
npm install aurelia-cli -g
```

After installation, you are able to make your custom project via `au new`.

### :gem: Aurelia 2

Just like Aurelia 1, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) first but be sure the version is `14.5.0` or above, then use the command below to make your skeleton.

```bash
npx makes aurelia
```

Now, choose your project's name and follow options.
