# :black_nib: Components

## :open_book: The Root Component

The root of any Aurelia application is a `single` component, which contains everything within the application, actually, the root component.

### :heart: Aurelia 1

```html
<!-- View -->
<!-- src/app.html -->

<require from="./styles.css"></require>
<require from="./nav-bar.html"></require>
<template>
    <h1>${message}</h1>
</template>
```

```ts
// ViewModel
// src/app(.js|.ts)

export class App {
    constructor() {
        this.message = 'Hello World!';
    }
}
```

* To import any style, component or etc, you should use `require`.
* Wrapping the whole HTML content via `template` is `necessary`.


### :gem: Aurelia 2

```html
<!-- View -->
<!-- src/my-app.html -->

<import from="./welcome"></import>
<import from="./about.html"></import>
<div class="message">${message}</div>
```
```ts
// ViewModel
// src/my-app(.js|.ts)

export class MyApp {
  public message = 'Hello World!';
}
```
```css
/* Style */
/* src/my-app.css */

nav {
  background: #eee;
  display: flex;
}
a {
  padding: 10px;
  text-decoration: none;
  color: black;
}
a:hover {
  background-color: darkgray;
}
.load-active {
  background-color: lightgray;
}
```

* Unlike version 1, There is a convention for loading your CSS file when the name is the same as component, just like `my-app.css`, so you don't need to import it manually.

* To import any style, component or etc you should use `import`. An alternative to `require` in version 1. By default, the components you create aren't global. What that means is that you can't use a component within another component, unless that component has been imported.

```html
<import from="./name-tag">

<h2>${message} <name-tag name.bind="to"></name-tag>!</h2>
<button click.trigger="leave()">Leave</button>
```

* Wrapping the whole HTML content via `template` is `optional`.

## :open_book: The Component Life-cycle

Every component instance has a life-cycle that you can tap into. This makes it easy for you to perform various actions at particular times.

| Name      | Aurelia 1 | Asyncable | Description |
|-----------|:---------:|:---------:|-------------|
|constructor|constructor|**✗**      |             |
|define     |**✗**      |**✓**      |             |
|hydrating  |           |**✓**      |             |
|hydrated   |           |**✓**      |             |
|created    |created    |**✓**      |             |
|binding    |bind       |**✓**      |             |
|bound      |           |**✓**      |             |
|attaching  |           |**✓**      |             |
|attached   |attached   |**✓**      |             |
|detaching  |           |**✓**      |             |
|unbinding  |unbind     |**✓**      |             |
|dispose    |detached   |**✓**      |             |
      
* Aurelia 1 has a restriction and the community made an [afterAttached](https://github.com/aurelia-ui-toolkits/aurelia-after-attached-plugin) plugin that is called after all child components are attached, and after all two-way bindings have completed. The good news is the `attached` life-cycle in version 2 covers this scenario.
      
**Which life-cycle hooks are most used?**

Such cases can be summarized.

|Name|When using it|
|----|-------------|
|binding|Fetch data (working with API services & Ajax calls), initialize data/subscriptions.|
|bound|Any work that relies on fromView/twoWay binding data coming from children, Defining router hooks.|
|attached|Use anything (like third-party libraries) that touches the DOM.|
|unbinding|Persisting data.|
|dispose|Cleanup data/subscriptions.|
